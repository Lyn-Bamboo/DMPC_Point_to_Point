## Reproduction of "Trajectory Generation for Multiagent Point-To-Point Transitions via Distributed Model Predictive Control" - MATLAB Code
This repository contains the MATLAB code used to reproduce the results presented in the paper "Trajectory Generation for Multiagent Point-To-Point Transitions via Distributed Model Predictive Control". The code implements the algorithms described in the paper, using MATLAB 2023b as the programming environment, with the YALMIP optimization toolbox and the OSQP solver for solving the optimization problems.

## Result
The implementation achieves the results as reported in the paper.
